  <h1>TabTidy — Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated: February 2026</strong></p>

  <p>TabTidy ("the Extension") is a Google Chrome extension that automatically 
  closes inactive browser tabs to help users save memory and keep their 
  browser tidy.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>TabTidy does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any 
  personal data. The extension does not have access to your browsing history, 
  passwords, personal information, or any other sensitive data.</p>

  <h2>Local Storage Only</h2>
  <p>The only data TabTidy stores is your personal settings such as your 
  inactivity timeout duration, whitelisted domains, and schedule preferences. 
  This data is stored entirely locally on your device using Chrome's built-in 
  storage API and never leaves your computer.</p>

  <h2>Tab Access</h2>
  <p>TabTidy requires access to your browser tabs solely to monitor inactivity 
  and close unused tabs based on your settings. The extension does not read, 
  record, or transmit the content of any tab or webpage you visit.</p>

  <h2>Third Party Services</h2>
  <p>TabTidy does not use any third party analytics, advertising, or tracking 
  services. The optional Buy Me a Coffee link opens an external website in a 
  new tab but no data is shared with that service by the extension.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If this privacy policy changes in the future, the updated version will be 
  published at this URL with a new date.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can reach out 
  via the Chrome Web Store support page for TabTidy.</p>
